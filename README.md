# Starbucks_App_Customer_Rewards_Program_Analysis

# Introduction 
In an increasingly competitive coffee retail market, customer loyalty programs are crucial for company growth and customer retention. Understanding how customers interact with promotional offers helps businesses tailor their marketing strategy to boost engagement and increase sales. In this project I aim to explore the structure of Starbucks' customer base and identify key factors that influence engagement with different promotional offers. The goal is to provide insights that can optimize marketing strategies and enhance the effectiveness of the Starbucks Rewards Program.
